RELEASE NOTES
-------------

**!!! NDK level 21 required !!!**

**This is a very rough update bumping cryptsetup to 1.7.0**

I've also bumped other packages. Mostly to recent versions, in some cases bit older ones (namely LVM and util-linux).

Older versions were necessary because newer did not compile for various reasons and I didn't have much time for debugging.

Patches were reduced to absolute minimum and removed in some cases. Minor updates to make process was necessary for some packages to compile.

NDK level 21 is required as latest util-linux wouldn't compile. This sadly means **no KitKat support** for the time being. This may change in the future as I believe that util-linux can be either downgraded or patched safely but I will not look into this unless someone needs it. Feel free to fork and patch, pull requests are welcome.



Original README follows:

To build the whole shebang, run: make.  It'll download the sources, untar
them, patch them, and set everything up, then build everything and install it
into external/lib, external/include, etc.

Build Products
--------------

The most interesting thing is probably: LUKS/external/sbin/cryptsetup.static

You can actually see a little UNIX hierarchy once everything builds:
LUKS/external/bin
LUKS/external/include
LUKS/external/lib
LUKS/external/sbin
LUKS/external/share


Notes About This Build
----------------------

- Android's bionic libc does not include getline() or getdelim(), so we needed
  to get it from GNU libc.  The getline.c, getline.h, getdelim.c, and
  getdelim.h files in the cryptsetup patch are from:
  http://android-wifi-tether.googlecode.com/svn/tools/wireless-tools/

- This was developed on an Ubuntu/Maverick i386 32-bit machine.  It might work
  on other setups, but no guarantees.

- config.guess and config.sub are included from libtool 2.4 to support the
  'arm-linux-androideabi' host type.  Most of the tarballs include older
  versions of those scripts, which do not know about the Android host type.

- some pkg-config files are included if you happen to want to use this stuff
  to build other programs for Android
